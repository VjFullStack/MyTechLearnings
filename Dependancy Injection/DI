Q. Can you explain , How does Composed objects can be easily replaced or modified without affecting
the class that uses them with java

In object-oriented programming, one way to easily replace or modify composed objects without affecting
the class that uses them is to use dependency injection.

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from the outside
rather than creating them itself. This can be useful when a class has dependencies that are prone to
change or when we want to be able to easily swap out one implementation of a dependency for another.

For example, consider a class called Car that has a dependency on an Engine object. We can use dependency
injection to pass in an Engine object to the Car class when it is created, rather than having the Car
class create its own Engine object. This allows us to easily swap out the Engine object for a different
implementation if needed, without affecting the Car class itself.

Here is some example code in Java that demonstrates how dependency injection can be used:

public class Car {
  private Engine engine;

  // constructor injection
  public Car(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }

  // method injection
  public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }
}

public interface Engine {
  void start();
}

public class V8Engine implements Engine {
  public void start() {
    // start the V8 engine
  }
}

public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
  public void start() {
    // start the electric engine
  }
}

// Example usage
Car car = new Car(new V8Engine());
car.start();

// We can easily replace the engine by using setEngine()
car.setEngine(new ElectricEngine());
car.start();


By using dependency injection, we can easily replace or modify the Engine object used by the Car class
without affecting the Car class itself. This can make it easier to maintain and extend our codebase over
time.

Q. How it is different from Spring depedancy injection

Spring is a Java framework that provides a range of features and tools for developing Java applications,
including support for dependency injection.

Spring's dependency injection feature allows you to use dependency injection in your Java applications
by using the Spring framework. This can be useful if you want to use dependency injection in a more
automated and configurable way, or if you want to take advantage of other features provided by the
Spring framework.

Spring's dependency injection is implemented using either constructor injection or setter injection,
which are both types of dependency injection. In constructor injection, dependencies are passed to the
class constructor when the object is created. In setter injection, dependencies are set using setter
methods on the class after the object is created.

Here is an example of how dependency injection can be used with Spring:

public class Car {
  private Engine engine;

  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }
}

@Service
public class V8Engine implements Engine {
  public void start() {
    // start the V8 engine
  }
}

@Service
public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
  public void start() {
    // start the electric engine
  }
}

In this example, the Car class is annotated with the @Autowired annotation, which tells Spring to
inject an Engine object into the Car class when it is created. The V8Engine and ElectricEngine classes
are annotated with the @Service annotation, which tells Spring that they are available to be injected
as dependencies.

Spring's dependency injection allows you to configure which implementation of a dependency should be
injected using configuration files or annotations. This can make it easier to manage dependencies in
a larger application and allow you to easily swap out one implementation of a dependency for another.

Q. what is solid principles?

= Solid is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Robert C. Martin that stands for five principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are:

  1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
  2. Open-Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
  4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

  These principles are intended to help developers create more maintainable and scalable software systems by promoting good design practices. They are particularly relevant for object-oriented programming, but can also be applied to other programming paradigms.

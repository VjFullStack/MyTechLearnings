# what is Spring Bean scope "Proxy" is it related to this design pateern
  
# Ans : 
Yes, the Spring Bean scope "proxy" is related to the Proxy design pattern.

In Spring, a bean can be scoped to "prototype", "singleton", "request", "session", "global session", or "proxy". When a bean is scoped as "proxy", Spring creates a proxy object that acts as a stand-in for the real object. The proxy object intercepts calls to the bean and delegates them to the real object as necessary.

The purpose of using a proxy bean in Spring is similar to the purpose of using the Proxy design pattern - to control access to the real object and add additional functionality to it. For example, a proxy bean can be used to add caching, security, or transaction management to a singleton bean.

It's worth noting that Spring uses a dynamic proxy to implement the "proxy" scope, which is different from the static proxy used in the Proxy design pattern. The dynamic proxy is created at runtime based on the interfaces implemented by the bean, while the static proxy is created at compile time and requires the creation of a separate class for each proxied class.

# what was the necessity of this bean scope? what purpose it solves. show me with code example?

# Ans : 

The purpose of bean scopes in Spring is to control the lifecycle of the beans and the way they are shared and accessed by other beans in the application.

For example, if a bean is scoped as a "prototype", a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested by another bean. This can be useful when the bean has state that needs to be unique for each instance, or when the bean is expensive to create and should be created only when needed.

On the other hand, if a bean is scoped as a "singleton", a single instance of the bean is created and shared by all beans that depend on it. This can be useful when the bean has no state or when the state can be shared among all instances.

The "proxy" scope is a special scope in Spring that creates a proxy object that acts as a stand-in for the real object. The proxy object intercepts calls to the bean and delegates them to the real object as necessary. This can be useful when we want to add additional functionality to the bean, such as caching, security, or transaction management.

Here's an example of how to use the "proxy" scope in Spring:

```
@Component
@Scope(value = "proxy", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class MyService {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the MyService class is annotated with @Component to make it a Spring bean. The @Scope annotation is used to set the scope to "proxy", and the proxyMode parameter is set to TARGET_CLASS, which tells Spring to create a CGLIB proxy object that extends the class of the bean.

Now, when a bean that depends on MyService requests an instance of it from the Spring container, Spring will create a proxy object instead of the real object. The proxy object intercepts all calls to MyService and delegates them to the real object as necessary. We can add additional functionality to the MyService bean by defining an aspect that intercepts the calls to it and adds the desired behavior.

```
@Aspect
@Component
public class MyServiceAspect {
    
    @Autowired
    private MyCache myCache;

    @Around("execution(* com.example.MyService.*(..))")
    public Object cache(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        // Check if the result is already cached
        String key = generateKey(joinPoint.getSignature().toString(), joinPoint.getArgs());
        Object result = myCache.get(key);
        if (result != null) {
            return result;
        }

        // Invoke the original method and cache the result
        result = joinPoint.proceed();
        myCache.put(key, result);
        return result;
    }

    private String generateKey(String signature, Object[] args) {
        // Generate a unique key based on the method signature and arguments
        // ...
    }
}

```
In this example, we define an aspect that intercepts calls to any method of MyService and checks if the result is already cached. If it is, the aspect returns the cached result. If not, the aspect invokes the original method and caches the result. We can add this aspect to our Spring configuration, and it will automatically be applied to all instances of MyService that are created by the Spring container.

# Q. so different bean scope is having different level of loading? lazy or early?

# Ans : 
Yes, different bean scopes in Spring have different levels of loading, which can be either lazy or eager (early) loading.

Eager loading means that the bean is created as soon as the application context is initialized. This means that the bean is immediately available for use by other beans in the application. Beans that are scoped as "singleton" or "proxy" are eager loaded by default.

Lazy loading means that the bean is created only when it is first requested by another bean. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage by avoiding the creation of objects that are not immediately needed. Beans that are scoped as "prototype" are lazy loaded by default, meaning a new instance of the bean is created only when it is requested.

In addition to the default lazy or eager loading behavior for each scope, Spring also provides the option to specify additional lazy or eager loading behavior using the @Lazy and @DependsOn annotations.

The @Lazy annotation can be used to specify that a bean should be lazily loaded even if it has a non-lazy scope, such as "singleton". For example:

```
@Component
@Scope(value = "singleton")
@Lazy
public class MySingletonBean {
    // ...
}

```

In this example, even though the bean is scoped as "singleton", it will be lazily loaded because of the @Lazy annotation.

The @DependsOn annotation can be used to specify that a bean should be eagerly loaded even if it has a lazy scope, such as "prototype". For example:

```
@Component
@Scope(value = "prototype")
@DependsOn("mySingletonBean")
public class MyPrototypeBean {
    // ...
}

```

In this example, even though the bean is scoped as "prototype", it will be eagerly loaded when the application context is initialized because of the @DependsOn annotation, which specifies that it depends on a singleton bean named "mySingletonBean".

# Q. what are conflicts in the bean scopes. for example when singleton calls prototype, or prototype calls proxy. 

# Ans: 

In Spring, conflicts can arise when beans with different scopes interact with each other. Here are a few examples of potential conflicts:

* Singleton calling Prototype:
If a singleton bean calls a prototype bean, Spring will create a new instance of the prototype bean for each call. This can cause problems if the prototype bean has state that needs to be maintained across multiple calls. In this case, it might be better to inject a prototype bean factory into the singleton bean and use it to create new instances of the prototype bean as needed.

* Prototype calling Singleton:
If a prototype bean calls a singleton bean, it may get a reference to a stale or inconsistent version of the singleton bean if the singleton bean is modified during the lifecycle of the application. In this case, it may be better to use method injection or a scoped proxy to ensure that the prototype bean always gets a fresh reference to the singleton bean.

* Prototype calling Proxy:
If a prototype bean calls a proxy bean, the proxy bean will always return the same instance of the target bean for each call. This can cause problems if the prototype bean requires a new instance of the target bean for each call. In this case, it may be better to use method injection or a scoped proxy to ensure that the prototype bean always gets a fresh instance of the target bean.

In general, it's important to carefully consider the interactions between beans with different scopes in your Spring application to avoid conflicts and ensure that the application behaves as expected.

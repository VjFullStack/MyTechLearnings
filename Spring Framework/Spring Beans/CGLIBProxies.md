# CGLIB Proxies

# Q. what is CGLIB proxy object

# Ans : 

CGLIB (Code Generation Library) is a powerful Java library that allows dynamic generation of Java bytecode at runtime. One of the main use cases for CGLIB is to create proxy objects for classes that do not implement any interfaces.

In the context of Spring Framework, CGLIB is often used to generate dynamic proxies for classes that are being managed by Spring's container. These proxies can be used to add extra behavior to the managed objects, such as logging or transaction management.

A CGLIB proxy object is a subclass of the target class that is generated at runtime using CGLIB. It intercepts method calls to the target object and can add extra behavior before or after the method is executed. For example, a CGLIB proxy object can be used to add transactional behavior to a target object without modifying its source code.

It's worth noting that CGLIB proxies work by subclassing the target class, so the target class cannot be final or have any final methods. Additionally, CGLIB proxies are typically slower than JDK dynamic proxies, which are generated using interfaces, because they involve subclassing and method interception at runtime.

# Q. why did you say "One of the main use cases for CGLIB is to create proxy objects for classes that do not implement any interfaces." Specifically?

# Ans : 

In Java, it's possible to create dynamic proxies using interfaces. However, when a class does not implement any interfaces, JDK dynamic proxies cannot be used. In this case, CGLIB can be used to generate a proxy object for the class.

CGLIB generates a subclass of the target class at runtime, which can be used to intercept method calls and add extra behavior. This allows developers to add functionality to classes that were not designed to be extensible or customizable, without modifying their source code.

Therefore, CGLIB is particularly useful for scenarios where a developer needs to create a proxy object for a class that doesn't implement any interfaces, or when the interfaces that the class implements do not cover all the methods that need to be intercepted.

# Q. so, when we manually create or implement proxy design pattern. realObject or ProxyObject must implement same interface. Is this the interface you are referring here?

# Ans : 

When using the traditional Proxy Design Pattern, the Real Object and the Proxy Object must implement the same interface. This is because the Proxy Object acts as a substitute for the Real Object, and should be indistinguishable from it to the client code that uses it.

By implementing the same interface as the Real Object, the Proxy Object can intercept method calls from the client and perform additional tasks before or after forwarding the call to the Real Object. This is known as the "structural contract" of the Proxy Pattern, where the Proxy Object and the Real Object have the same public interface, and the client code uses them interchangeably.

However, when using CGLIB to create dynamic proxies, the target class does not need to implement an interface, as CGLIB generates a subclass of the target class and intercepts method calls using that subclass. In this case, the Proxy Object is a subclass of the Real Object, but does not implement the same interface. Instead, it provides additional methods or behaviors that the Real Object does not have.

# Q. you said acts as a substitute. is this liskov substitution principle?

# Ans : 

Yes, the concept of the Proxy Object acting as a substitute for the Real Object is related to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in object-oriented programming.

The Liskov Substitution Principle is a fundamental principle of object-oriented design, which states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be able to replace its superclass without breaking the functionality of the program.

In the context of the Proxy Pattern, the Proxy Object acts as a substitute for the Real Object, and should be interchangeable with it in the client code. This means that the Proxy Object must have the same public interface as the Real Object, and should behave in the same way as the Real Object in response to method calls from the client code.

By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, the Proxy Pattern ensures that the client code can use the Proxy Object and the Real Object interchangeably, without affecting the correctness of the program.

# Q. why CGLIB proxies are slower than JDK dynamic proxies?

# Ans : 

CGLIB proxies are typically slower than JDK dynamic proxies because they use a different approach to generate the proxy objects.

JDK dynamic proxies are created using interfaces, where the proxy object is a dynamically generated implementation of the interface that intercepts method calls and delegates them to an underlying target object. This approach is generally faster because it relies on the JVM's built-in support for interface invocation, which is optimized for performance.

In contrast, CGLIB proxies generate a subclass of the target class at runtime, which overrides the methods of the target class and intercepts their calls using bytecode manipulation. This approach requires more overhead than JDK dynamic proxies because it involves creating a new class and using bytecode manipulation to intercept method calls.

Furthermore, CGLIB proxies involve more runtime reflection and method interception than JDK dynamic proxies, which can add additional overhead to the method invocation process.

Despite these performance differences, CGLIB proxies have some advantages over JDK dynamic proxies. For example, CGLIB can be used to generate proxies for classes that do not implement any interfaces, and it can also intercept calls to non-public and final methods, which are not possible with JDK dynamic proxies.

# Q. Spring uses CGLIB internally for proxy bean scope?

# Ans : 

In the Spring Framework, CGLIB is used internally to create proxy objects for classes that are managed by the Spring container. One of the main use cases for CGLIB in Spring is to provide AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) support, which allows developers to add cross-cutting concerns, such as logging and transaction management, to their code.

When a bean is declared with a scope that requires a proxy, such as "prototype" or "request", Spring creates a proxy object using CGLIB. This proxy object intercepts method calls to the target bean and can add additional behavior, such as managing the lifecycle of the bean or adding transactional behavior.

Spring also uses CGLIB to create proxies for classes that do not implement any interfaces, which is not possible with JDK dynamic proxies. This allows developers to apply AOP to a wider range of classes, even if they do not implement any interfaces.

In summary, CGLIB is an important part of the Spring Framework's AOP support, and is used internally to create proxy objects for beans that require proxying, allowing developers to add additional behavior to their code without modifying the source code of the target class.

Q. Do RestTempate uses Serializable?

RestTemplate is a class in the Spring Framework that is used to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP
responses. It is not directly related to the Serializable interface in Java.

RestTemplate is used to make HTTP requests to RESTful web services. It is often used to consume
REST APIs over HTTP. When making an HTTP request, RestTemplate converts the request body (if any) and
request parameters into a byte stream, and when receiving an HTTP response, it converts the response body
(if any) from a byte stream into an object. This process is similar to serialization and deserialization,
but it is not the same thing.

RestTemplate uses a HttpMessageConverter to convert the request and response bodies between Java
objects and HTTP messages. By default, RestTemplate supports the following types of message converters:

1. ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter: Converts byte arrays.
2. StringHttpMessageConverter: Converts strings.
3. FormHttpMessageConverter: Converts form data to and from a MultiValueMap<String, String>.
4. Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter: Converts Java objects to and from XML using JAXB2.
5. MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter: Converts Java objects to and from JSON using the Jackson library.
So, to answer your question, RestTemplate does not use the Serializable interface directly.
However, if you are using RestTemplate to consume a REST API that returns serialized Java objects,
then those objects might need to implement the Serializable interface in order to be deserialized properly.
